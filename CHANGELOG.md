## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-09

First public release.

### Added

- `/jump` panel that lists every prompt of the current conversation, newest first, numbered in conversation order.
- Search by words (all words must match) or by number (`12`, `#12`), also as an argument: `/jump bypass`, `/jump 12`.
- Jump to a prompt by scrolling the transcript to it. The panel stays open so you can hop between prompts.
- Works right after `--resume`, including prompts you have not scrolled to yet, by reading prompt rows from the session transcript.
- Leaves out rewound prompts, slash commands, task notifications and messages from other sessions.
- Cuts long Korean, Chinese and Japanese prompts to the panel width by terminal cell width.
